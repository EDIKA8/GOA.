  <h1>What is HTML</h1>
  
  <p>The web is a collection of documents, which are stored in servers. Many of these documents are written in a language called HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

    The term hypertext refers to text that includes links (also called hyperlinks) to other text.
    
    HTML documents are made up of:
    
    Text - The words we see on a page.
    
    Links to other pages.
    
    Markup - Determines what the text looks like and how that text and other content is arranged on the page.
    
    References to other documents - Videos, images, code editors, etc.
    
    HTML code does not execute logic or perform calculations like Python. There are no for loops, if/else statements, or functions. Instead, HTML is an example of a markup language. Markup languages provide instructions for what text should look like on the screen. They format the text of a document (like the size of a section heading) and define the structure of the page (like the number of sections or placement of images).
    
    HTML uses two main components, elements and tags, to define the structure of a web page.
